3 / 8Course Website
The course website is hosted via Quercus. If you encounter access issues, please contact the Head
TA. The course website will be available from the rst day of class until the nal exam is given.
All lectures, lab oce hours, tutorials and oce hours are synchronous online until
January 30 and in-person from January 31, 2022. Administrative aspects of the course
will be discussed on Quercus. For questions and discussion of technical course material you will
have plenty of opportunities to ask questions directly from your instructors and TAs during/after
lectures, tutorials, lab as well as during instructor and tutorial/lab TA oce hours. You should
take full advantage of these opportunities.

Homework
There will be 10 homework sets assigned for practice. Homework problems are posted on the
Quercus course website with solutions. The homework is good preparation and allows you to keep
on top of the material covered. Homework will not be collected or graded. The midterms and nal
will assume that you have completed and understood all assigned homework problems.
Laboratory Information
There will be three MATLAB -based labs, with due dates listed below. The lab documents are posted
on the Quercus course website.
4 / 8Lab Topic Due Date
1 Signal Processing in MATLAB Fri, Jan 28, 2022 11:59pm
2 Response of RLC Circuits Fri, Feb 18, 2022 11:59pm
3 Music Synthesis Fri, Mar 18, 2022 11:59pm
The labs must be completed in groups of two, which will be established via Quercus. You will join
a group by using the group self sign-up feature found in Quercus- >People. The group members do
notneed to be in the same practical section. Please sign-up by January 18, 2022, 11:59pm, or you
will be randomly assigned a lab partner. If needed, you may e-mail the Head TA for assistance in
group pairing. Both group members are expected to contribute equally to the lab completion; they
will get identical marks, unless special circumstances occur.
Each lab group will work remotely. Completed lab sheets will be submitted via Quercus. Late
submissions will not be accepted. For general lab questions, please contact the Head Lab TA.
During the week each lab is due, there are ve 2-hour lab oce-hour slots , open to students
inall sections . A number of lab TAs will be answering your questions and clarications. Lab
TAs will not be able to answer questions sent via email, so these lab oce hours will be your
only opportunity to seek help and clarications on the labs. As they are open to all sections, take
advantage of them and go to as many lab oce hours as you need.

5 / 8Late Submission Policy
We do not accept late online submissions, under any circumstance. We do not accept submissions
via email. This policy is strictly enforced. A late submission will receive a mark of 0. If you deem
it unavoidable to submit a deliverable after the deadline, you need to contact the Head TA before
the deadline, explain the circumstances surrounding the expected delay, and check whether or not
he/she gives you permission to submit late. In the absence of such an advance permission, the
policy above applies.
Assessment Dates and Grading Scheme

Final 40% Date/time to be announced
Midterms and Final: There will be two midterms and one nal exam.
Each midterm will be 1.5 hours in length and the exam is 2.5 hours long.
Midterm 1 is held on Tuesday, Feb 8, 6-7:30pm. Location will be announced via Quercus.
Midterm 2 is held on Tuesday, Mar 22, 6-7:30pm. Location will be announced via Quercus.
To help in your preparation during the week preceding each of the two midterms and the nal exam
there will be several tutorial TA oce hours. In all there will be eight 2 hour-slots of tutorial
oce-hours open to students in all sections . Times and room location will be announced via the
course website. Take full advantage of these sessions to ask directly your questions on the course
material. Additionally, take advantage of synchronous/in person delivery and ask questions from
your instructors during/after the lectures and during their oce hours.
Regrading procedure: Please contact the Head TA via e-mail with all requests for regrading, and
include a clear and concise statement indicating (i) which questions were graded incorrectly and (ii)
why you deserve more points. Regrade requests will only be accepted within two weeks following
the return of an assessment. The instructors reserve the right to fully regrade any assessment, and
as such regrading may result in a lower overall grade.
Land Acknowledgement
I (we) wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands
of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the
Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous
people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
Inclusivity, Accommodations and Mental Health Support
6 / 8Statement on Inclusivity You belong here. The University of Toronto commits to all students,
faculty and sta that you can learn, work and create in a welcoming, respectful and inclusive
environment. In this class, we embrace the broadest range of people and encourage their diverse
perspectives. This team environment is how we will innovate and improve our collective academic
success. You can read the evidence for this approach here.
We expect each of us to take responsibility for the impact that our language, actions and interactions
have on others. Engineering denounces discrimination, harassment and unwelcoming behaviour in
all its forms. You have rights under the Ontario Human Rights Code. If you experience or witness
any form of harassment or discrimination, including but not limited to, acts of racism, sexism,
Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism and ageism, please tell someone
so we can intervene. Engineering takes these reports extremely seriously. You can talk to anyone you
feel comfortable approaching, including your professor or TA, an academic advisor, our Assistant
Dean, Diversity, Inclusion and Professionalism, the Engineering Equity Diversity and Inclusion
Action Group, any sta member or a U of T Equity Oce.
You are not alone. Here you can nd a list of clubs and groups that support people who identify
in many diverse ways. Working together, we can all achieve our full potential.
Statement on Accommodations The University of Toronto supports accommodations for stu-
dents with diverse learning needs, which may be associated with mental health conditions, learning
disabilities, autism spectrum, ADHD, mobility impairments, functional/ne motor impairments,
concussion or head injury, blindness and low vision, chronic health conditions, addictions, deafness
and hearing loss, communication disorders and/or temporary disabilities, such as fractures and
severe sprains, or recovery from an operation.
If you have a learning need requiring an accommodation the University of Toronto recommends
that students register as soon as possible with Accessibility Services.
Phone: 416-978-8060
Email: accessibility.services@utoronto.ca
Statement on Mental Health As a university student, you may experience a range of health
and/or mental health challenges that could result in signicant barriers to achieving your personal
and academic goals. Please note, the University of Toronto and the Faculty of Applied Science &
Engineering oer a wide range of free and condential services that could assist you during these
times.
As a U of T Engineering student, you have an Academic Advisor (undergraduate students) or a
Graduate Administrator (graduate students) who can support you by advising on personal matters
that impact your academics. Other resources that you may nd helpful are listed on the U of T
Engineering Mental Health & Wellness webpage, and a small selection are also included here:
â€¢Accessibility Services & the On-Location Advisor
â€¢Graduate Engineering Council of Students' Mental Wellness Commission
â€¢Health & Wellness and the On-Location Health & Wellness Engineering Counsellor
â€¢Inclusion & Transition Advisor
