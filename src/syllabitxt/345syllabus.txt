Textbook and Class Contents
The required textbook for this course is T. Cormen, C. Leiserson, R. Rivest, C. Stein (CLRS), \ Introduction to
Algorithms ," McGraw Hill 2009 (3rd edition). CLRS is a well-written comprehensive textbook used by most major
universities. No other text is required and no lecture notes will be distributed.
In this class we will cover the following material:
â€¢Background: asymptotics, recurrences, combinatorics, randomization, graphs and trees (Chapters 1 : : :5, Appen-
dices A, B and C)
â€¢Sorting: quicksort and analysis, heapsort and analysis, other sorting methods, lower bounds in sorting and
selection in linear time (Chapters 6 : : :9)
â€¢Binary Search trees, Red-Black trees, Amortized Analysis, Splay trees, Hashing (Chapters 10 : : :13, 17)
â€¢Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms (Chapters 15 and 16)
â€¢Basic graph algorithms (breadth-rst search, depth-rst search) (Chapter 22)
â€¢Minimum Spanning Trees and Single Source Shortest Paths (Chapters 23 and 24)
â€¢An Introduction to Maximum Flow (Chapter 26)
â€¢Introduction to theory of computation and NP-Completeness (Chapter 34)
â€¢Introduction to Blockchain Technologies (Handout)
Course Webpage
All ocial announcements will be posted on Quercus ( q.utoronto.ca ).It is your own responsibility to check it at
regular intervals, i.e. once per day . It is strongly recommend to select \Notify immediately" for course announcements
in your account notication settings. This will forward all announcements to your university email. Questions on
the material ( i.e.,lectures, exams, tutorials, etc) should be asked during tutorial sessions, on Piazza, or sent to the
ECF course email: ece.algorithms+345@gmail.com .
On Quercus you will nd weekly reading assignments from CLRS and supplementary readings, homework assign-
ments, sample problem solutions, previous exams and other useful resources, including the lecture videos from Fall
2020. All homeworks will be submitted via Quercus.
COVID-19 Measures
For the Fall 2022 term all course activities will be in-person. As such, you must abide by the University of Toronto's
vaccination and face mask policy in order to attend in-person lectures and tutorial. Links containing relevant
information have been provided below:
â€¢COVID-19 FAQ : https://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/covid-19/
â€¢Vaccination Policy : https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/vaccines
â€¢Face Mask Policy : https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/masksUofToronto{ECE 345{Fall, 2022 3 Course Information
Face Mask Requirements During Lecture/Tutorials : The University's mandatory mask requirement is cur-
rently suspended. However, the use of a medical mask in high-density indoor spaces when physical distancing is not
possible is strongly encouraged. The University is a mask-friendly environment, and we ask everyone to respect each
other's decisions, comfort levels, and health needs.
Course Requirements and Grading Scheme
The nal grade for this class has three components:
â€¢homeworks: There will be ve homeworks you will do in groups of 2-3 students. You can switch groups between
homeworks but you will receive the group grade each time. More details about proper homework submission
are on Quercus. Deadlines for homeworks are nal! Absolutely no late homework will be accepted. Homeworks
account for 25% of your grade (5% each).
â€¢midterm exam: There will be one midterm of two hours and it is open CLRS book. The midterm accounts
for 35% of the grade.
â€¢nal exam: Open CLRS book, two and half hours and 40% of the grade.
Exam dates and rooms will be announced at a later time. Exam material will be simpler versions of the problems
you will see in the homework. Exam type material will be practiced regularly at tutorials.
Remarking: You have exactly seven (7) working days to submit your work (homework or midterm) for remarking
from the time marks are released. There are NO exceptions to this rule and no late homework will be remarked . To
request a remark, state the problem number(s) submitted for remarking, the reason you believe you were marked
unfairly, and the name and email address of the group member(s) who should be contacted for clarications in an
email, attach a pdf of your homework and any TA feedback received (e.g. annotations on the homework, rubrics on
Quercus, etc.), and send to the ECF course email ( ece.algorithms+345@gmail.com ). If there is a legitimate reason
for a late assignment or exam absence (illness, etc.), please email the ECF course email. Keep in mind that ocial
documentation (doctor letter, etc) is required for an exemption. When a homework or midterm is submitted for
remarking, the entire document may be regraded (not just the sections you believe were marked unfairly) and it is
possible you will receive a lower mark than before if we determine the initial grader was too generous.
Cheating Policy
Cheating is against \fair{play" and will not be tolerated under any circumstances. While the pressures of many
classes, homeworks, work and/or extracurricular activities can be overwhelming, this is never an excuse for copying
solutions from others. The University holds among its highest principles the notion of academic freedom
and integrity. Cheaters will face the University's disciplinary committee as well as receive a failing
grade in this course. If you think that there is an issue that inuences your performance in the class then talk to
the instructor.
How to Get the Most out of this Course
You are urged to read the textbook sections posted in the weekly reading assignments, as it is quite thorough, with
many examples and with good motivating discussions and intuitions. The internet is full of additional scientic and
historical material. Do a lot of practice problems from the book. Read the course webpage regularly and email the
TAs if you have any questions. Attend lectures, tutorials and oce hours. Keep up with the pace of the class. Make
sure you understand the solution to all homework questions, even if someone else in your group completed it.
