ECE302H1F 202 2 - Probability and  Applications  
FALL 202 2 
 
Description:  Engineers  and scientists  deal  with  systems,  devices,  and environments  that  contain  
unavoidable elements of randomness. Probability theory is a mathematical tool that allows logical ways  
to reason about knowledge and uncertainty. This course introduces 3rd - and 4th -year electrical and  
computer  engineering  students  to basic concepts  in probability  theory.  
 
ECE302  2020  Learning  Outcomes  
• Understand  the basic  concepts  of probability,  random  variables,  probability  distribution,  and 
joint probability  distribution.  
• Acquire  basic  knowledge  of discrete  and continuous,  univariate,  and multi -variate  probability  
distribution  functions.  
• Have  an appreciation  for probabilistic  analysis  techniques.

Homework  Problems  / Readings  
 
While  ECE302  is one of the most  interesting  and useful  courses  in electrical  and computer  engineering,  it 
is also a challenging upper -year course. To do well in this course you must keep up to date with the     
class schedule . The best way to accomplish this is to practice , through the assigned homework  and other 
exercise problems. In Fall 20 21 homework problems have been pre -announced, and their  solutions 
have been posted  one week after the tutorial session . Thus, homework solutions will not be collected, 
but you are required to  work  out the problems  whe n the pertinent  material  is covered  and before  you 
consult  the solutions.
