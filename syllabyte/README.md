# Welcome to Syllabyte

Many productivity apps are customizable to the user, but at the cost of becoming fussy and high maintenance. With this in mind, we created a time management app that requires as little user input as possible. We want Syllabyte to feel like an aid and never a chore!


# How to use me
To use the terminal UI, cd into backend/brain and run views.py
This will open a prototyped version of Syllabyte that will display 3 courses that were used as dummy data. You can change course priorities and see assignments change priority.
